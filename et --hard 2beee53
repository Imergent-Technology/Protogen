    feat: Separate Scenes and Decks interfaces with unified selection component
    
    This commit addresses several admin interface issues and establishes a foundation for better scene/deck management:
    
    ## Key Changes
    
    ### 🔧 Fixed Core Issues
    - **Slug Field Behavior**: Auto-populate only on blur when empty, allow manual editing
    - **Decks Tab Routing**: Fixed /decks route to properly render DeckManager
    - **Duplicate Scene Creation**: Unified Create Scene button, moved view options to flyout menu
    - **Contexts Placeholder**: Added placeholder UI for Context Management
    - **Flows Tab**: Added placeholder tab for future Flow Management
    
    ### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
    - **Separated Interfaces**: SceneManager and DeckManager are now completely independent
    - **Removed Tab System**: No more confusing tab navigation between scenes and decks
    - **Unified SelectionModal**: Reusable component for multi-selection scenarios
    
    ### 🎯 New SelectionModal Component
    - Multi-select with Ctrl/Cmd+Click and Shift+Click range selection
    - Grid and list view modes with search functionality
    - Visual highlighting for selected items
    - Configurable for any selectable content type
    - Click-outside-to-close behavior
    
    ### 📁 File Structure
    - Added SelectionModal to common components
    - Created proper exports for decks components
    - Updated navigation to include Flows tab
    - Cleaned up component dependencies
    
    ## Next Steps
    - Implement scene-to-deck relationship management
    - Add deck-to-scene relationship management
    - Extend SelectionModal for other use cases
    - Complete Contexts and Flows interfaces
    
    This establishes a solid foundation for the admin interface overhaul.
