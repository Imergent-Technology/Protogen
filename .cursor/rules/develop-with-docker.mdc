description: Build and Test From Base Directory

- Build test and run the dev environment from the base directory as it is all wired up to run from there.
- Run the development environment using Docker Compose unless a specific need arises.
- Check for an existing Tailwind build process and start one at the beginning of a new agent conversation or development session.
- Favor running vite/tailwind/npm build commands using the scripts defined in the base directory instead of individual sub-projects.
- Before beginning a significant change during a new session, be sure you understand the project structure by reviewing the development docs at least in summary, if not in depth depending on the need at the time.
