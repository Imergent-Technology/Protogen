## üìÑ Document Details

### 1. README.md - The North Star

**Purpose**: Single source of truth for current strategic direction

**Key Sections**:
- Vision summary (exploration, cohesion, feedback goals)
- Strategic reorder rationale (why graph-first vs authoring-first)
- Sprint overview (Sprints 1-5 detailed)
- Work being parked (Card authoring, M2-M3 deferred)
- Success metrics per sprint
- Reference documentation guide
- Timeline (Oct 21 - Dec 2, 2025)

**Use Case**: "What are we building and why?"

---

### 2. CURRENT_SPRINT.md - Active Sprint Tracker

**Purpose**: Living document tracking Sprint 1 progress

**Key Sections**:
- Sprint goal (Graph Studio extraction)
- 9 detailed tasks with estimates
- Blockers section
- Completed work log
- Next sprint preview
- Progress tracking

**Use Case**: "What am I working on today?"

**Status**: Ready for Sprint 1 kickoff (Oct 21, 2025)

---

### 3. BACKLOG.md - Prioritized Feature Backlog

**Purpose**: Clear prioritization of all work (P0-P4)

**Key Sections**:
- **P0: Critical Path** (Sprints 1-3, graph foundation)
- **P1: Core Experience** (Sprint 4, navigation layer)
- **P2: Engagement** (Sprint 5, user feedback)
- **P3: Deferred** (Sprints 6+, authoring polish)
- **P4: Future** (Graph authoring, video, wishlist)

**Total Estimated Effort**: 140-200 hours through Sprint 5

**Use Case**: "What's coming next and when?"

---

### 4. DECISIONS.md - Strategic Decisions Log

**Purpose**: Record key decisions with rationale

**Decisions Documented**:
1. **Graph-First Priority** - Graph is foundation, build it first
2. **Strategic Pause on Card Authoring** - Document bugs, revisit later
3. **Defer M2-M3** - Document/Video authoring wait for graph
4. **Exploration Before Creation** - Align with user goals

**Use Case**: "Why did we choose this approach?"

---

### 5. INTEGRATION_NOTES.md - Documentation Bridge

**Purpose**: Connect strategic-focus to other Protogen docs

**Key Sections**:
- Relationship to Authoring-Unification specs
- Relationship to DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md
- Relationship to core-foundation.md
- What to reference when
- What to ignore for now
- Documentation hierarchy
- Navigation guide for AI agents

**Use Case**: "How does this fit with existing docs?"

---

## üîÑ Main README Update

Updated `/README.md` to add prominent Strategic Focus section:

**Location**: Top of Documentation section  
**Content**: Links to all 5 strategic-focus documents  
**Call-out**: "START HERE for current development priorities"  
**AI Agent Note**: Reference path for orientation

---

## üéØ Strategic Alignment

### Problem Solved

**Before**:
- Multiple planning documents (18 authoring specs, roadmaps, status files)
- Unclear priorities (M1‚ÜíM2‚ÜíM3 vs other work)
- AI agents confused about what to work on
- Stakeholders unclear on direction

**After**:
- Single North Star (`strategic-focus/README.md`)
- Clear priorities (P0-P4 backlog)
- Active sprint visibility (CURRENT_SPRINT.md)
- Decision rationale documented (DECISIONS.md)
- Integration clarity (INTEGRATION_NOTES.md)

### Key Decisions Captured

1. **Graph-First**: Building foundation before authoring
2. **Sprint-Based**: 5 focused sprints (7 weeks total)
3. **Deferred Work**: Card/Document authoring after graph
4. **Clear Metrics**: Success criteria per sprint

### Target Outcomes

**By Sprint 3** (3 weeks): Interactive graph exploration  
**By Sprint 4** (5 weeks): Cohesive navigation  
**By Sprint 5** (7 weeks): User engagement  
**By Sprint 6+** (10+ weeks): Authoring polish

## üß≠ How to Use

### For Developers

**Session Start**:
1. Read `strategic-focus/README.md` (North Star)
2. Check `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` (active tasks)
3. Begin work on current sprint

**During Work**:
- Reference `INTEGRATION_NOTES.md` for related docs
- Update `CURRENT_SPRINT.md` as tasks complete
- Record decisions in `DECISIONS.md`

**Sprint End**:
- Update `BACKLOG.md` with learnings
- Create next sprint in `CURRENT_SPRINT.md`
- Update `README.md` timeline if needed

### For AI Agents

**Orientation Command**:
```
"Reference /docs/active-development/strategic-focus/ for current priorities"
```

**Navigation**:
1. Start with README.md for strategy
2. Check CURRENT_SPRINT.md for active work
3. Use INTEGRATION_NOTES.md to find related docs
4. Follow BACKLOG.md for what's next

### For Stakeholders

**Questions Answered**:
- What are we building? ‚Üí README.md (Vision section)
- Why this order? ‚Üí README.md (Strategic Reorder section)
- What's the status? ‚Üí CURRENT_SPRINT.md
- When will X be done? ‚Üí BACKLOG.md (Timeline)
- Why did we decide Y? ‚Üí DECISIONS.md

## üìä Impact Metrics

### Documentation Organization

**Before**:
- 18 authoring specs (excellent but wrong priority)
- Multiple roadmaps (conflicting sequences)
- Status files (historical, not current)

**After**:
- 1 North Star (clear direction)
- 1 active sprint (current work)
- 1 backlog (prioritized future)
- 1 decisions log (rationale recorded)
- 1 integration guide (context bridge)

### Clarity Improvement

**Priority Confusion**: ELIMINATED ‚úÖ
- Was: M1 (Card) ‚Üí M2 (Document) ‚Üí M3 (Graph)
- Now: Graph ‚Üí Navigation ‚Üí Feedback ‚Üí Authoring

**Current Work Ambiguity**: ELIMINATED ‚úÖ
- Was: Multiple potential starting points
- Now: Sprint 1 tasks clearly defined

**Decision Rationale Clarity**: IMPROVED ‚úÖ
- Was: Decisions scattered in various docs
- Now: All decisions logged with context
