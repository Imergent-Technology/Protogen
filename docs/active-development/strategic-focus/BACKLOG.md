## Backlog Maintenance

### Review Cycle
- **Weekly**: Update sprint progress
- **Bi-weekly**: Reprioritize P1-P2 items
- **Monthly**: Review P3-P4, add new items

### Promotion Criteria
- **P3 ‚Üí P2**: When becomes blocker for P2 work
- **P2 ‚Üí P1**: When critical for core experience
- **P1 ‚Üí P0**: When becomes immediate blocker

### Demotion Criteria
- **Lower Priority**: When dependencies not met
- **Future**: When effort exceeds value
- **Archive**: When no longer relevant
