# Strategic Focus: Graph-First Development

**Status**: Active

## üéØ Vision

Build an **interactive exploration platform** where users can:
- **Explore** knowledge graphs with zoom, focus, and dialog orchestration
- **Navigate** cohesively through decks ‚Üí scenes ‚Üí nodes with clear context
- **Engage** through context-sensitive feedback, comments, and bookmarks

**Core Principle**: Graph is the foundation. Everything else builds on it.

## üîÑ Strategic Reorder: Why Graph-First?

### The Problem with Authoring-First

The original Authoring-Unification plan (M1‚ÜíM2‚ÜíM3) was:
- M1: Card Scene Authoring (6-8 weeks)
- M2: Document Scene Authoring (4-6 weeks)
- M3: Graph Scene Authoring (4-6 weeks)

**Issue**: Graph came LAST, but it's the FOUNDATION for:
- Linking between content (cards need to link to graph nodes)
- Navigation flows (scenes are organized via graph relationships)
- Context (everything anchors to graph structure)
- Exploration (your stated #1 goal requires working graph)

### The Solution: Graph-First

**New Priority Order**:
1. **Graph Viewing & Exploration** (3 weeks) - Foundation
2. **Navigation & Cohesion** (2-3 weeks) - Build on foundation
3. **User Feedback** (2 weeks) - Engagement layer
4. **Card Authoring Polish** (2-3 weeks) - Now makes sense in context
5. **Document Authoring** (4-6 weeks) - Future milestone

**Rationale**: Build the steering wheel before adding more passengers.

**Deliverable**: Reusable Graph Studio system  
**Status**: üîÑ Active (see CURRENT_SPRINT.md)

### Sprint 2: Portal Graph Viewer (Week 2)

**Deliverable**: Graph scenes viewable in portal  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Sprint 3: Interactive Features (Week 3)
**Goal**: Zoom, focus, dialog orchestration  
**Deliverable**: Rich interactive graph exploration  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Sprint 4: Navigation Layer (Weeks 4-5)
**Goal**: Cohesive deck‚Üíscene‚Üínode flows  
**Deliverable**: Seamless navigation across hierarchy  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Sprint 5: User Feedback (Weeks 6-7)
**Goal**: Context-sensitive comments and bookmarks  
**Deliverable**: Users can engage meaningfully  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Pending

### Sprint 6+: Future Work
**Goal**: Card authoring polish, document authoring  
**Status**: ‚è≥ Backlog (see BACKLOG.md)

## üö´ Work Being Parked

### Card Scene Authoring
- **Status**: Partially implemented, has bugs
- **Action**: Strategic pause, document bugs, mark as experimental
- **Revisit**: Sprint 6+ after graph foundation solid
- **Rationale**: Cards need to link to graph nodes; foundation needed first

### Authoring-Unification Specs (M2-M3)
- **Status**: 18 excellent specs completed
- **Action**: Reference as needed, don't follow M1‚ÜíM2‚ÜíM3 sequence
- **Revisit**: Document authoring in Sprint 8+
- **Rationale**: Specs are great, but prioritization was backwards

### Other Deferred Work
- Document scene authoring
- Video scene planning
- Advanced authoring features
- See BACKLOG.md for full list

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

### Sprint 1 Success
- ‚úÖ Graph Studio runs from shared library
- ‚úÖ Admin still works (no regression)
- ‚úÖ Clean API for portal integration

### Sprint 2 Success
- ‚úÖ Graph scenes render in portal
- ‚úÖ Can click nodes and see basic info
- ‚úÖ No critical bugs

### Sprint 3 Success
- ‚úÖ Zoom/focus animations smooth (< 300ms)
- ‚úÖ Dialog orchestration working
- ‚úÖ Can explore related nodes easily

### Sprint 4 Success
- ‚úÖ Complete navigation: deck ‚Üí scene ‚Üí node
- ‚úÖ Users never feel lost (breadcrumbs work)
- ‚úÖ URL sharing works

### Sprint 5 Success
- ‚úÖ Users can comment on any node
- ‚úÖ Bookmarking functional
- ‚úÖ Feedback visible in context

## üìñ Key Strategic Decisions

See [DECISIONS.md](./DECISIONS.md) for full details.

**TL;DR**:
1. **Graph-First Priority** - Graph is foundation, build it first
2. **Strategic Pause on Card Authoring** - Document bugs, revisit later
3. **Defer M2-M3** - Document/Video authoring wait until graph solid
