# Sprint 1 Completion Summary

**Sprint**: Graph Studio Extraction  
**Duration**: October 19, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE  
**Time**: 2.75 hours (estimated 12-18 hours)

---

## 🎯 Sprint Goal Achievement

**Goal**: Extract Graph Studio from admin to shared library, making it reusable for portal integration.

**Result**: ✅ ACHIEVED

The Graph Studio system is now a fully functional, reusable module in `@protogen/shared/systems/graph-studio` that can be imported and used by any application (portal, admin, future mobile app).

---

## ✅ Deliverables Completed

### Core System Architecture

**GraphStudioSystem** (`GraphStudioSystem.ts`):
- Singleton pattern following Navigator/Dialog system patterns
- Complete state management (nodes, edges, selection, filters)
- Event emission system (7 event types)
- Methods: loadGraph, selectNode, setViewMode, setFilters
- ~250 lines

**useGraphStudio Hook** (`hooks/useGraphStudio.ts`):
- React integration with GraphStudioSystem
- State synchronization via event subscriptions
- Actions: loadGraph, selectNode, setViewMode, setFilters, etc.
- ~200 lines

### Visualization Components

**GraphCanvas** (`components/GraphCanvas.tsx`):
- Core Sigma.js visualization (simplified from 1088 → 320 lines)
- Node dragging with position persistence
- Selection highlighting
- Configurable via props (colors, zoom, labels)
- Removed admin-specific dependencies

**GraphStudio** (`components/GraphStudio.tsx`):
- Complete graph viewer with loading/error/empty states
- Integrates GraphCanvas with useGraphStudio hook
- Props-driven, reusable across applications
- ~130 lines

### Supporting Infrastructure

**Types** (`types/graph.ts`):
- NodePosition, GraphViewMode, GraphDisplayMode
- GraphStudioConfig, GraphStudioState
- GraphStudioEvent enum and event map
- GraphCanvasProps interface
- ~150 lines

**Services** (`services/GraphDataService.ts`):
- API integration helpers
- loadCoreGraph(), loadSubgraph()
- Filtering helpers: filterNodesByType, getConnectedNodes, searchNodes
- ~120 lines

**Utils** (`utils/`):
- `colors.ts`: Node/edge color mapping, selection colors
- `layout.ts`: Grid positioning, force calculation helpers
- ~140 lines combined

### Testing

**Unit Tests** (`__tests__/GraphStudioSystem.test.ts`):
- 10 comprehensive tests
- Coverage: singleton, initialization, loading, selection, filtering
- Following Jest/RTL patterns
- ~300 lines

### Configuration

**Package Exports** (`package.json`):
- Added `./systems/graph-studio` subpath export
- Follows existing system module pattern
- TypeScript declarations included

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

### Sprint 1 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Graph Studio runs from shared library**: Can import via `@protogen/shared/systems/graph-studio`
- ✅ **Admin still works**: Admin unchanged, no regressions
- ✅ **Clean API for portal integration**: GraphStudio component ready for portal import

---

## 🚀 Key Achievements

### Extraction Strategy Success

**Simplified Complexity**:
- GraphCanvas: 1088 lines → 320 lines (70% reduction)
- Removed admin-specific code (context menus, dialogs, toolbars)
- Focused on core visualization capabilities
- Made fully props-driven and reusable

**Pattern Consistency**:
- Follows Protogen system patterns (singleton, events, hooks)
- Uses existing shared infrastructure (EventEmitter, ApiClient)
- Integrates with type system (CoreGraphNode, CoreGraphEdge)
- Clean separation of concerns

**Ready for Portal**:
- Zero external dependencies beyond Sigma.js
- Props-driven, no hardcoded admin logic
- Loading/error/empty states handled
- Can be styled via className prop

---

## 🔑 Technical Decisions

### Decision: Keep Admin As-Is
**Rationale**: Admin Graph Studio already works with advanced features (filters, subgraph management, authoring dialogs). Sprint 1 goal is to make reusable components for portal, not migrate admin.

**Impact**: 
- Admin keeps working without disruption ✅
- Portal can use shared components (Sprint 2) ✅
- Can migrate admin later if desired

### Decision: Simplified GraphCanvas
**Rationale**: Admin GraphCanvas had 1088 lines including complex drag logic, context menus, multiple initialization attempts. Simplified to core visualization.

**Impact**:
- Easier to maintain ✅
- Faster to integrate ✅
- Can add features back incrementally

### Decision: Defer Authoring Features
**Rationale**: Sprint 1 focused on viewing/exploration. Authoring (node creation, edge creation) aligned with future sprints.

**Impact**:
- Faster extraction ✅
- Portal gets viewing first ✅
- Can add authoring in Sprint 3+ when needed

---

## 📦 What's Ready for Sprint 2

### Portal Integration Can Begin

**Import and use**:
```typescript
import { GraphStudio, useGraphStudio, graphStudioSystem } from '@protogen/shared/systems/graph-studio';
```

**Simple usage**:
```typescript
// In portal component
export function GraphSceneViewer({ sceneId }: { sceneId: string }) {
  const { loadGraph, nodes, edges } = useGraphStudio();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load graph data
    GraphDataService.loadCoreGraph().then(data => {
      loadGraph(data.nodes, data.edges);
    });
  }, []);
  
  return <GraphStudio onNodeSelect={(node) => console.log(node)} />;
}
```

**Portal can now**:
- Import graph-studio system ✅
- Render interactive graphs ✅
- Handle node selection ✅
- Build on this foundation ✅

---

## 🔄 Next Steps (Sprint 2)

### Create GraphSceneViewer in Portal

**Tasks**:
1. Create `portal/src/features/graph-viewer/` folder
2. Create GraphSceneViewer component
3. Connect to subgraph loading API
4. Integrate with Navigator for routing
5. Add node detail dialog
6. Basic styling and layout

**Target**: Week of October 28, 2025

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Pattern Replication**: Following existing Protogen patterns (Navigator, Dialog) made extraction straightforward
2. **TypeScript-First**: Defining types early prevented issues
3. **Incremental Commits**: 4 commits kept progress trackable
4. **Build Verification**: Building after each major change caught issues early

### What Could Improve

1. **Dependency Analysis**: Could have checked Sigma.js in shared dependencies earlier
2. **Import Paths**: Needed to discover CoreGraphNode was in ApiClient, not types module
3. **Scope Definition**: Initial tasks were too granular, combined naturally during work

### For Sprint 2

1. **Start with integration test**: Create portal component early to drive requirements
2. **API discovery**: Verify subgraph loading APIs work as expected
3. **Dialog integration**: Plan for node detail dialogs upfront

---

## 🎉 Sprint 1: SUCCESS

All 9 tasks complete, all success criteria met, ready for Sprint 2.

**Efficiency**: Completed in 2.75 hours vs estimated 12-18 hours (5-6x faster)  
**Quality**: Zero TypeScript errors, 10 tests, clean architecture  
**Readiness**: Portal integration can begin immediately
