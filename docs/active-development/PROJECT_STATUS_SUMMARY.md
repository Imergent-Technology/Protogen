## 🔄 **In Progress**

### Scene Management (Phase 2.5)
- **Completed** (2.5.1 & 2.5.2):
  - Services and hooks in shared library
  - Create Scene dialog with Form Flow
  - Manage Scenes with search/filter/pagination
  - End-to-end scene creation verified

- **Next** (2.5.3):
  - Scene Viewer Integration
  - SceneEditButton in viewer
  - SceneContextMenu for quick actions
  - Permission-based controls

---

## 📋 **Planned (Priority Order)**

1. **Phase 2.5.3**: Scene Viewer Integration (Immediate)
2. **Phase 3**: Admin UI for Toolbar Configuration (Short-term)
3. **Phase 4**: Bookmarks & Comments System (Medium-term)
4. **Phase 6**: Enhanced Engagement Features (Long-term)
5. **Phase 7**: Unified Portal Migration (Long-term)

## 🎯 **Technical Debt & Known Issues**

### Minor Issues (Non-Blocking)
- ⚠️ DialogStack "key prop in spread" warnings
- ⚠️ DialogContent accessibility warnings (title/description)
- ⚠️ Widget registry "already registered" warnings (dev mode)
- ⚠️ Some @ts-nocheck comments in service files

### Testing Gaps
- Edit Scene dialog not yet tested end-to-end
- Create Deck dialog not yet tested end-to-end
- No automated tests for Flow System (manual testing complete)
- No automated tests for Scene Management (manual testing complete)

### Future Enhancements
- Server-side pagination for large datasets
- Bulk operations (multi-select, bulk delete)
- Scene templates and cloning
- Advanced search with filters
- Export/import functionality

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### For New Development
1. Review [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](./DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for current phase
2. Check [DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md](./DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md) for system status
3. See [QUICK_REFERENCE.md](./QUICK_REFERENCE.md) for import paths and examples

### To Continue Scene Management
1. Review Phase 2.5.3 in [PHASE_2_SCENE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md](./PHASE_2_SCENE_MANAGEMENT_PLAN.md)
2. Check existing components in `portal/src/features/scene-management/components/`
3. Test Edit Scene and Create Deck dialogs
4. Implement SceneEditButton and SceneContextMenu

### To Start New Feature
1. Check if related systems are complete (see "Production-Ready Systems")
2. Review architectural patterns in session reports
3. Follow established patterns (Flow System for forms, Full-Screen for management)

---

## 📊 **Metrics**

### Code Stats (Approximate)
- **Shared Library**: ~15,000 lines
- **Portal**: ~8,000 lines
- **API**: ~12,000 lines
- **Total Systems**: 9 complete, 3 in progress

### Feature Completeness
- **Navigation**: 95% complete
- **Dialogs**: 100% complete (6 types)
- **Flows**: 90% complete (core done, advanced features planned)
- **Scene Management**: 70% complete (services/dialogs done, viewer integration next)
- **Authoring**: 60% complete (extracted, needs integration)
- **Comments/Bookmarks**: 0% (planned)

---

## 🎓 **Architectural Patterns Established**

1. **Singleton Pattern**: FlowSystem, DialogSystem, NavigatorSystem, ToolbarSystem
2. **Event-Driven Communication**: Custom EventEmitter for cross-system events
3. **Service Layer**: Separate services from UI components for better testability
4. **Form Flows**: Standard pattern for all multi-step CRUD operations
5. **Full-Screen Dialogs**: Standard for data management UIs
6. **Metadata Storage**: Store dialog-specific config in metadata field
7. **Field Mapping**: Handle frontend/backend differences in service layer

---

## 🎉 **Recent Wins**

- ✅ Flow System replacing wizard concept - cleaner architecture
- ✅ Full-screen dialogs solving cramped management UI problem
- ✅ Form data persistence fixed - reliable multi-step forms
- ✅ End-to-end scene creation working - users can create content
- ✅ Search/filter/pagination in management UI - professional UX

---

**Next Session**: Continue with Phase 2.5.3 (Scene Viewer Integration) or pivot to Phase 3 (Admin UI) based on priorities.
