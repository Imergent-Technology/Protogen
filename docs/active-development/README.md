# Active Development Documentation

## 🎯 **Purpose**

This folder contains documentation for features currently being developed, recently completed, or in active planning phases. These documents represent the current state of development work and are subject to frequent updates as features evolve.

## 📁 **Current Active Development Areas**

### **Portal Foundation** ✅
- `PORTAL_FOUNDATION.md` - Complete Portal foundation setup, issues resolved, and current status

### **Unified Portal Design**
- `UNIFIED_PORTAL_DESIGN.md` - Comprehensive unified portal architecture, migration strategy, and implementation plan

### **Navigator Systems Architecture**
- `NAVIGATOR_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Integrated architecture for Navigator, Flow, Context, and Engagement systems

### **Development Planning**
- `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Comprehensive development roadmap with phases and timelines

### **Scene Authoring and Slide System**
- `SCENE_AUTHORING_LIBRARY_STRATEGY.md` - Scene authoring library strategy with Slide System
- `ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Orchestrator system with slide coordination

### **Graph Studio and Flow System**
- `GRAPH_STUDIO_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Graph Studio enhancements
- `FLOW_SYSTEM_VISION.md` - Flow System vision and architecture

## 🔄 **Document Lifecycle**

### **Active Development Phase**
- Documents are frequently updated as features evolve
- Implementation details are refined based on development progress
- Architecture decisions are documented and updated

### **Completion Phase**
- Documents are finalized and moved to main docs folder
- Implementation details are locked in
- Documents become reference material

### **Maintenance Phase**
- Documents are updated only for bug fixes or minor improvements
- Major changes require new active development documents

## 📋 **Documentation Standards**

### **For Active Development Documents**
- **Clear Status**: Document current implementation status
- **Recent Updates**: Include recent changes and decisions
- **Implementation Details**: Provide specific implementation guidance
- **Integration Points**: Document how features integrate with existing systems

### **For Completed Features**
- **Final Architecture**: Document the final implemented architecture
- **API Documentation**: Complete API endpoints and usage
- **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with the feature
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## 🎯 **Quick Reference**

### **Current Priority Areas**
1. **Slide System Implementation** - Dynamic content with transitions (Phase 1)
2. **Navigator System Enhancement** - Enhanced navigation with slide support (Phase 2)
3. **Unified Portal Migration** - Admin functionality integration (Phase 6)
4. **Flow System Implementation** - Guided user experiences (Phase 4)

### **Recent Achievements**
- ✅ Portal Foundation complete and operational
- ✅ Navigator System Foundation implemented
- ✅ Modern app-like UI with responsive design
- ✅ OAuth authentication working
- ✅ Documentation consolidated and organized

### **Next Steps**
- 🎯 Phase 1: Slide System Implementation (2-3 weeks)
- 🧭 Phase 2: Navigator System Enhancement (2-3 weeks)
- 🎯 Phase 3: Enhanced Context System (1-2 weeks)

## 📚 **Related Documentation**

For stable, long-standing project documentation, see the main `docs/` folder:
- `core-foundation.md` - Core architectural principles
- `context-system.md` - Context system implementation
- `snapshot-system.md` - Snapshot system documentation
- `PERMISSIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Permissions and standing system
- `implementation-roadmap.md` - Overall project roadmap

## 📦 **Archive**

The `archive/` folder contains historical development documents that have been consolidated into the main documentation files. These files are preserved for reference but are no longer actively maintained:

- Portal Foundation documents (consolidated into `PORTAL_FOUNDATION.md`)
- Unified Portal documents (consolidated into `UNIFIED_PORTAL_DESIGN.md`)
- Navigator System documents (consolidated into `NAVIGATOR_SYSTEMS_ARCHITECTURE.md`)
- Development planning documents (consolidated into `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`)

## 🔧 **Maintenance**

This folder should be regularly reviewed to:
- Move completed features to main documentation
- Archive outdated development documents
- Update active development status
- Ensure documentation reflects current implementation state
