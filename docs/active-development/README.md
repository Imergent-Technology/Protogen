# Active Development Documentation

## üéØ **Purpose**

This folder contains documentation for features currently being developed, recently completed, or in active planning phases. These documents represent the current state of development work and are subject to frequent updates as features evolve.

## üìÅ **Current Active Development Areas**

### **Unified Portal System**
- `UNIFIED_PORTAL_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Architecture for unifying Admin and Portal
- `UNIFIED_PORTAL_MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md` - Strategy for migrating Admin to Portal
- `UNIFIED_PORTAL_ROADMAP.md` - Implementation roadmap for Portal unification
- `UNIFIED_PORTAL_SYSTEM_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Updated system documentation
- `UNIFIED_PORTAL_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md` - Validation criteria and checklist

### **Navigator, Flow, Context, and Engagement Systems**
- `NAVIGATOR_FLOW_CONTEXT_ENGAGEMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Integrated architecture
- `NAVIGATOR_FLOW_CONTEXT_ENGAGEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md` - Implementation recommendations
- `NAVIGATOR_FLOW_CONTEXT_ENGAGEMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Implementation roadmap

### **Scene Authoring and Slide System**
- `SCENE_AUTHORING_LIBRARY_STRATEGY.md` - Scene authoring library strategy with Slide System
- `ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Orchestrator system with slide coordination

### **Graph Studio and Flow System**
- `GRAPH_STUDIO_ENHANCEMENT.md` - Graph Studio enhancements
- `FLOW_SYSTEM_VISION.md` - Flow System vision and architecture

## üîÑ **Document Lifecycle**

### **Active Development Phase**
- Documents are frequently updated as features evolve
- Implementation details are refined based on development progress
- Architecture decisions are documented and updated

### **Completion Phase**
- Documents are finalized and moved to main docs folder
- Implementation details are locked in
- Documents become reference material

### **Maintenance Phase**
- Documents are updated only for bug fixes or minor improvements
- Major changes require new active development documents

## üìã **Documentation Standards**

### **For Active Development Documents**
- **Clear Status**: Document current implementation status
- **Recent Updates**: Include recent changes and decisions
- **Implementation Details**: Provide specific implementation guidance
- **Integration Points**: Document how features integrate with existing systems

### **For Completed Features**
- **Final Architecture**: Document the final implemented architecture
- **API Documentation**: Complete API endpoints and usage
- **Integration Guide**: How to integrate with the feature
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

## üéØ **Quick Reference**

### **Current Priority Areas**
1. **Unified Portal Architecture** - Primary focus for Portal unification
2. **Slide System Integration** - Scene authoring with slide capabilities
3. **Navigator System** - Content navigation and traversal
4. **Flow System** - Guided user experiences

### **Recent Additions**
- Slide System architecture integrated into Scene Authoring
- Orchestrator system documentation for slide coordination
- Navigator integration points for slide navigation
- Context system enhancements for slide contexts

## üìö **Related Documentation**

For stable, long-standing project documentation, see the main `docs/` folder:
- `core-foundation.md` - Core architectural principles
- `context-system.md` - Context system implementation
- `snapshot-system.md` - Snapshot system documentation
- `PERMISSIONS_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Permissions and standing system
- `implementation-roadmap.md` - Overall project roadmap

## üîß **Maintenance**

This folder should be regularly reviewed to:
- Move completed features to main documentation
- Archive outdated development documents
- Update active development status
- Ensure documentation reflects current implementation state
