- **Updates**:
  - Updated context types to reflect scene-centric slide management
  - Added scene slide navigation examples
  - Removed outdated slide navigation patterns
  - Clarified that scenes own and manage slides

### **2. Development Roadmap**
- **File**: `docs/active-development/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
- **Updates**:
  - Moved scene-centric architecture to "Completed" section
  - Updated current priority to Flow System implementation
  - Added comprehensive scene-centric completion checklist
  - Updated timeline and phases

### **3. Development Status**
- **File**: `docs/active-development/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`
- **Updates**:
  - Added scene-centric architecture to completed systems
  - Updated implementation status with all completed components
  - Removed outdated slide system implementation items
  - Added comprehensive completion checklist

### **4. Quick Reference**
- **File**: `docs/active-development/QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- **Updates**:
  - Updated current priority to Flow System
  - Added scene-centric architecture completion status
  - Updated database schema to reflect implemented fields
  - Added animation cascade information

### **5. Active Development README**
- **File**: `docs/active-development/README.md`
- **Updates**:
  - Added scene-centric architecture as complete
  - Updated document references
  - Added implementation complete documentation
  - Marked scene-centric as ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### **6. Archive Management**
- **Actions**:
  - Moved `SLIDE_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` to archive
  - Moved `SLIDE_SYSTEM_PROGRESS.md` to archive
  - Moved `SLIDE_SYSTEM_TEST_RESULTS.md` to archive
  - These files are now historical references

## üéØ **Key Architectural Changes Reflected**

### **Scene-Centric Design**
- Scenes fully own and control their slides
- No standalone slide system
- Clear ownership and responsibility
- Animation cascade: System ‚Üí Scene ‚Üí Slide

### **Animation System**
- Framer Motion integration
- Simple entrance/exit animations
- Configurable duration and easing
- Direction-aware transitions

### **Integration Architecture**
- Navigator delegates to Scene System
- Event-driven communication
- No circular dependencies
- Context synchronization

## üìä **Documentation Statistics**

### **Files Updated**: 5
### **Files Archived**: 3
### **Lines Changed**: 200+
### **Status**: All documentation now accurate ‚úÖ

## üé¨ **Current Documentation State**

### **‚úÖ Accurate and Current**
- All documentation reflects scene-centric architecture
- Implementation status is accurate
- Roadmap shows correct priorities
- Quick reference is up-to-date

### **üìÅ Well Organized**
- Active development docs in main folder
- Historical docs in archive folder
- Clear status indicators
- Easy navigation

### **üéØ Ready for Next Phase**
- Flow System is clearly next priority
- All scene-centric work documented as complete
