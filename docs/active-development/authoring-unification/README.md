## Key Decisions

### This IS Protogen

- **Not** a separate "Endogen" project
- **Not** a rewrite or parallel system
- **IS** Protogen's evolution
- **IS** backward compatible

### Integration First

Every specification:
- Shows integration with existing systems
- Extends rather than replaces
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Follows established patterns

### Scene Type Priority

1. **Card** (Phase 1) - Validates approach
2. **Document** (Phase 2) - Real-world use case
3. **Graph** (Phase 3) - Requires design workshop
4. **Video** (Phase 4) - Deferred

3. Follow established Protogen patterns
4. Reference existing systems for consistency
5. **No coding until planning phase complete**

### For Reviewers

1. Check integration points with existing systems
2. Verify backward compatibility
3. Validate test strategies

## Deliverable Type

**Planning Phase** (Current):
- Specifications (interfaces, contracts, diagrams)
- Type definitions (TypeScript-style)
- Test strategies
- Migration plans
- **NO production code**

**Implementation Phase** (Future):
- TypeScript implementation
- React components
- Jest/RTL tests
- Updated documentation
- Incremental rollout

---

## Integration with Existing Work

Per `docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODO_PLAN.md`:

### Coordinates With

- **TypeScript Error Resolution**: Follow existing strict mode patterns
- **Testing Foundation**: Use established Jest/RTL infrastructure
- **Documentation Updates**: Cross-reference with existing docs
- **Store Type Improvements**: New stores follow Zustand patterns

### May Integrate Later

- **Admin Menu Builder**: Consider unified configuration
- **Permission System**: Authoring requires permission integration
