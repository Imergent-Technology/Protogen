## Key Decisions

### This IS Protogen

- **Not** a separate "Endogen" project
- **Not** a rewrite or parallel system
- **IS** Protogen's evolution
- **IS** backward compatible

### Integration First

Every specification:
- Shows integration with existing systems
- Extends rather than replaces
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Follows established patterns

### Scene Type Priority

1. **Card** (Phase 1) - Validates approach
2. **Document** (Phase 2) - Real-world use case
3. **Graph** (Phase 3) - Requires design workshop
4. **Video** (Phase 4) - Deferred

- [ ] Clear interfaces and contracts
- [ ] Integration points with Protogen systems
- [ ] TypeScript-style type definitions
- [ ] State diagrams or flow charts (where applicable)
- [ ] Test strategy
- [ ] Acceptance criteria checklist

### Overall Initiative

- [ ] All 18 specifications complete

- Type definitions (TypeScript-style)
- Test strategies
- Migration plans
- **NO production code**

**Implementation Phase** (Future):
- TypeScript implementation
- React components

- Incremental rollout

---

## Integration with Existing Work

Per `docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODO_PLAN.md`:

### Coordinates With

- **TypeScript Error Resolution**: Follow existing strict mode patterns
- **Testing Foundation**: Use established Jest/RTL infrastructure
- **Documentation Updates**: Cross-reference with existing docs
- **Store Type Improvements**: New stores follow Zustand patterns

### May Integrate Later

- **Admin Menu Builder**: Consider unified configuration
