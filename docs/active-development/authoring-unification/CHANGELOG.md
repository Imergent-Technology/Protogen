## Key Decisions

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Authoring = Viewing + Controls**: Authoring overlay pattern chosen over separate UIs
2. **Preview On-Save**: Thumbnails generated on save, not real-time
3. **ToC in Drawer**: Left drawer integration for consistent UX
4. **Carousel Optional**: Widget with declarative visibility rules
5. **Plugin Architecture**: Scene-type extensibility via plugins
6. **Orchestrator Extension**: Extend existing system, don't create new one

### Technical Decisions

1. **Event-Driven**: Events primary communication mechanism
2. **Lazy Loading**: Authoring libraries load only in author mode
3. **Three Size Tiers**: XS/SM/MD for different UI contexts
4. **Offscreen Rendering**: Canvas-based preview generation
5. **TipTap for RTE**: Rich text editing with TipTap
6. **ARIA Tree**: ToC uses ARIA tree pattern

### Scope Decisions

1. **Card First**: Simplest scene type validates approach
2. **Document Second**: Real-world use case with complexity
3. **Graph Workshop**: Requires dedicated design session
4. **Video Deferred**: Too complex for initial release

---

## Integration Points

### With Existing Protogen Systems

✅ **Navigator**: Mode management, item navigation, zoom/focus  
✅ **Toolbar**: ToC drawer (left), Properties drawer (right), Carousel widget  
✅ **Dialog**: Context menus, property inspectors, wizards  
✅ **Scene**: Extended with Card, Document, Graph, Video types  
✅ **Orchestrator**: Library loading, policy enforcement  
✅ **Theme**: Selection colors, highlighting strategies

### New Systems (Integrated)

✅ **Authoring System**: Mode management, selection, editing  
✅ **Preview Service**: Thumbnail generation and caching  
✅ **Selection Engine**: Scene-type specific selection logic  
✅ **Highlighting Engine**: Theme-aware visual feedback

   - Clearer terminology

3. **Integration Focus**: Every spec shows integration points
   - All specs reference existing Protogen systems
   - Backward compatibility emphasized throughout

### Additions Beyond Original Scope

## Open Questions & Next Steps

### Requires Stakeholder Decision

1. **M1 Start Date**: When to begin implementation? (Prerequisites: Phase 2.5.3, TypeScript < 20 errors, Testing 70%+)
2. **Resource Allocation**: Can we allocate 2-3 FTE for M1?
3. **Graph Design Workshop**: When to schedule? (2-hour session needed before M3)
4. **Video Priority**: Pursue M4 or defer indefinitely?
5. **Budget Approval**: Approve 36.5-52 person-week effort?

### Requires Technical Validation

1. **Offscreen Canvas Performance**: Validate preview generation meets budgets
2. **TipTap Bundle Size**: Verify rich text editor acceptable size
3. **Large Graph Performance**: Test with 1000+ node graphs
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Validate drawer strategy on devices

### Documentation Tasks

1. **Create Formal ADRs**: Move ADR specs (007-012) to `docs/decisions/`
2. **Update Main Roadmap**: Integrate M1-M3 into `DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md`
3. **Update README**: Add authoring initiative to main README
4. **Archive Planning Docs**: After implementation, archive these specs
