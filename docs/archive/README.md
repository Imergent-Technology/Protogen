## Archive Policy

### When to Archive

Documents should be moved to archive when they:

1. Describe completed phases that are now in production
2. Document migrations that have been fully completed
3. Represent historical decisions superseded by ADRs
4. Are session reports from completed development sessions
5. Are planning documents for implemented features

### When to Keep Active

Documents should remain active when they:

1. Describe current or planned architecture
2. Provide reference for ongoing development
3. Document systems still in use
4. Serve as implementation guides
5. Define current development status or roadmap

### Archive Maintenance

- Archived documents are preserved for historical reference
- No modifications should be made to archived documents
- References to archived documents in active docs should use `docs/archive/` path
- Archive is reviewed periodically for organization

---

## Document History

- **Initial Archive Creation**: October 2025
- **Consolidated from**: `docs/active-development/archive/`
- **Base Directory Cleanup**: October 14, 2025 (moved 10 files from project root)
- **Total Archived Documents**: 45 files
- **Archive Organization**: By category (session reports, implementations, visions, migrations)

## Notes

This archive serves as the historical record of Protogen's development journey. While these documents are no longer actively referenced for current development, they provide valuable context for understanding the evolution of the platform's architecture and design decisions.

For architectural decisions, see the ADR documents in `docs/decisions/` which formalize key architectural choices extracted from these historical documents.
