  - Singleton pattern for application-wide flow management
  - Template registration and instance management
  - Event-driven architecture with custom EventEmitter
  - Flow state tracking and persistence

- **Type System** (`shared/src/systems/flow/types/`)
  - `Flow`, `FlowStep`, `FlowStepType` interfaces
  - `ConditionalRule` and `FlowBranch` for branching logic
  - `FlowTemplate` for reusable flow definitions
  - `StepGuidance` for user assistance

#### **Form Flow Sub-Module**
- **FlowRenderer Component** (`shared/src/systems/flow/components/FlowRenderer.tsx`)
  - Multi-step form rendering with progress indicator
  - Step navigation (next/previous/complete)
  - Validation handling with error display
  - Form data persistence across steps (critical bug fix)
  - Integration with FormStep, SelectionStep, ReviewStep

- **Step Components** (`shared/src/systems/flow/form/components/steps/`)
  - **FormStep**: Dynamic field rendering (text, textarea, checkbox, select)
  - **SelectionStep**: Choice-based steps with multiple display modes
  - **ReviewStep**: Data review with formatted display

- **Key Features**
  - Auto-generation (e.g., slug from name)
  - Field-level validation with error feedback
  - Conditional step visibility
  - Guidance messages per step
  - Transform functions for data formatting

### 2. Scene Management System (Phase 2.5.1-2.5.2 - Complete)

#### **Services Layer** (Phase 2.5.1)
- **Type Definitions** (`shared/src/systems/scene-management/types/`)
  - SceneConfig, DeckConfig, SlideConfig interfaces
  - Create/Update/Delete input types
  - Permission and metadata types

- **Services** (`shared/src/systems/scene-management/services/`)
  - SceneManagementService with full CRUD operations
  - DeckManagementService
  - SlideManagementService
  - API field mapping (frontend `type` → backend `scene_type`)
  - Fixed API endpoint paths (removed double `/api` prefix)

- **React Hooks** (`shared/src/systems/scene-management/hooks/`)
  - useSceneManagement, useDeckManagement, useSlideManagement

#### **Dialog UI** (Phase 2.5.2)
- **CreateSceneDialog** (`portal/src/features/scene-management/dialogs/CreateSceneDialog.tsx`)
  - 4-step Form Flow implementation
  - Steps: Basic Details → Scene Type → Visibility & Access → Review
  - Field validation and error handling
  - Auto-slug generation from name
  - Success/error toast notifications
  - **Status**: ✅ Fully functional, tested end-to-end

- **ManageScenesDialog** (`portal/src/features/scene-management/dialogs/ManageScenesDialog.tsx`)

  - Type filter (Graph, Card, Document, Dashboard)
  - Status filter (Active, Inactive, Public, Private)
  - Client-side pagination with configurable items per page
  - Action buttons: View, Edit, Delete
  - Empty states and loading states
  - **Status**: ✅ Fully functional

- **EditSceneDialog** (`portal/src/features/scene-management/dialogs/EditSceneDialog.tsx`)

  - Same 4-step flow as create
  - **Status**: ✅ Implemented, needs testing

- **CreateDeckDialog** (`portal/src/features/scene-management/dialogs/CreateDeckDialog.tsx`)
  - Form flow for deck creation
  - **Status**: ✅ Implemented, needs testing

### 3. Full-Screen Dialog Type (New System Feature)

#### **Dialog System Enhancement**
- **Type Definition** (`shared/src/systems/dialog/types/fullscreen.ts`)
  - FullScreenDialogConfig with custom size options
  - Separate size type to avoid base class conflicts

- **FullScreenDialog Component** (`shared/src/systems/dialog/components/FullScreenDialog.tsx`)
  - Takes 90-95% of viewport width/height
  - Dark backdrop with click-to-close
  - Sticky header with title, description, and header actions
  - Scrollable content area
  - Optional sticky footer
  - Close button and escape key support
  - Size variants: default (max-w-6xl), large (max-w-7xl), xlarge (90vw)

- **DialogSystem Integration** (`shared/src/systems/dialog/DialogSystem.ts`)
  - New `openFullScreen()` method
  - Metadata-based property storage for fullscreen-specific config

- **DialogStack Integration** (`shared/src/systems/dialog/components/DialogStack.tsx`)
  - Renders FullScreenDialog for type='fullscreen'

## 🐛 **Critical Bug Fixes**

### Form Data Persistence
**Issue**: Form data was lost when navigating backward between steps  
**Root Cause**: FlowRenderer was replacing entire formData instead of merging  
**Fix**: Changed `setFormData(newData)` to `setFormData(prev => ({ ...prev, ...newData }))`  
**Impact**: Multi-step forms now properly retain all data across navigation

### Checkbox Boolean Handling
**Issue**: Unchecked checkboxes showed "Not provided" in review step  
**Root Cause**: FormStep initialized all fields with empty string, review didn't format booleans  
**Fix**: 
- FormStep now uses type-appropriate defaults (false for checkbox, '' for others)
- Review step formats boolean values as "Yes"/"No"
- Checkbox rendering uses explicit `!!formData[field.id]`  
**Impact**: Proper boolean display throughout the flow

### API Endpoint Path Issues
**Issue**: API calls resulted in 404 with `/api/api/scenes` double path  
**Root Cause**: ApiClient baseUrl included `/api`, services also prefixed with `/api`  
**Fix**: Removed `/api` prefix from service baseUrl definitions  
**Impact**: All scene/deck/slide API calls now use correct endpoints

### Field Name Mapping
**Issue**: Backend validation failed with 422 "Unprocessable Content"  
**Root Cause**: Frontend sent `type`, backend expected `scene_type`  
**Fix**: Added transformation layer in SceneManagementService.createScene()  
**Impact**: Frontend/backend communication now works seamlessly

## 🎓 **Technical Lessons & Decisions**

### 1. Form State Management Pattern
**Decision**: Parent component (FlowRenderer) manages all form data; child components (FormStep) sync via props  
**Rationale**: Allows cross-step data access, auto-generation, and validation  
**Implementation**: FormStep useEffect with `[data, fields]` dependencies for reactive sync

### 2. API Response Unwrapping
**Pattern**: Backend returns `{ success, data, message }` wrapped in ApiClient's `{ data: ApiResponse }`  
**Solution**: Defensive unwrapping with fallbacks: `result?.data?.data || result?.data || []`  
**Application**: Used in ManageScenesDialog to handle various response structures

### 3. Type System Conflicts
**Issue**: FullScreenDialogConfig.size conflicted with BaseDialogConfig.size  
**Solution**: Used `Omit<BaseDialogConfig, 'size'>` and custom `fullscreenSize` property  
**Learning**: When extending base types, check for property name conflicts

### 4. Singleton Pattern Usage
**Applied To**: FlowSystem, DialogSystem, NavigatorSystem, ToolbarSystem  
**Benefit**: Single source of truth, proper event propagation, no duplicate instances  
**Pattern**: Private constructor, static instance, exported singleton const

## 🧪 **Testing Completed**

### End-to-End Tests (Manual)
- ✅ Create Scene flow (all 4 steps)
- ✅ Form data persistence (backward/forward navigation)
- ✅ Checkbox boolean handling
- ✅ Auto-slug generation
- ✅ Field validation and error display
- ✅ Scene creation API integration
- ✅ Database persistence verification
- ✅ Manage Scenes dialog (search, filter, pagination)
- ✅ Delete scene with confirmation

### Known Issues (Deferred)
- ⚠️ DialogStack "key prop in spread" warnings (React best practice, non-blocking)
- ⚠️ DialogContent accessibility warnings (title/description, non-blocking)
- ⚠️ Widget registry "already registered" warnings (dev mode double mount, harmless)
- ⚠️ Edit Scene and Create Deck flows not yet tested end-to-end

---

## 📊 **Metrics**

### Code Added
- ~2,500 lines of production code
- ~15 new components
- ~10 new services/hooks
- ~5 new type definition files

### Systems Completed
- Flow System (100%)
- Form Flow Sub-Module (100%)
- Scene Management Services (100%)
- Scene Management Dialog UI (90% - viewer integration remaining)
- Full-Screen Dialog (100%)

### Database Verification
Verified scene creation in PostgreSQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM scenes ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
-- Result: id=18, name="New Scene", slug="new-scene", scene_type="card"
```

---

## 🎯 **Next Priorities**

### Immediate (Phase 2.5.3)
1. Scene Viewer Integration
   - Add SceneEditButton to scene viewer
   - Implement SceneContextMenu for quick actions
   - Add permission checks for edit/delete buttons
   - Toast notifications for scene actions

### Short-term
1. Test Edit Scene dialog end-to-end
2. Test Create Deck dialog end-to-end
3. Implement Manage Decks full-screen dialog
4. Clean up console warnings (low priority)

### Medium-term
1. Admin UI for Toolbar Configuration (Phase 3)
2. Bookmarks & Comments System (Phase 4)
3. Enhanced Flow features (templates, branching UI)

---

## 💡 **Key Insights**

1. **Form Flow Success**: Merging wizard into Flow System was the right architectural decision. Form Flow is cleaner, more flexible, and better integrated than a standalone wizard would have been.

2. **Full-Screen Dialog Need**: Data management UIs need more space than standard modals. The full-screen dialog type is reusable and will benefit deck/slide management and future admin features.

3. **Field Mapping Layer**: Frontend/backend field name differences (type vs scene_type) are best handled in the service layer, keeping components clean and backend-agnostic.

4. **Client-Side Pagination**: For initial implementation, client-side pagination is simpler and sufficient. Can migrate to server-side when dataset grows.
