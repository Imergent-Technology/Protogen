# Protogen Core Foundation Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the core architectural principles and implementation details for the Protogen system, establishing a durable foundation for scalable graph applications with advanced presentation and collaboration features in a multi-tenant environment.

## Historical Context

Protogen represents a significant architectural evolution to the current Scene & Deck architecture. This transformation was driven by the need for:

- **Greater Flexibility**: Modern architecture supports diverse content types
- **Better Performance**: Scene-based architecture enables more efficient content delivery
- **Multi-Tenant Support**: Clean separation of concerns enables isolated content environments
- **Modern Development**: React-based UI with TypeScript and comprehensive tooling

The project has evolved through 7 completed phases, with a clean, modern architecture. The system now operates entirely on the Scene & Deck foundation described in this document.

## ðŸš€ **Current Evolution: Central Graph System**

**Status**: In Development - See [Central Graph Roadmap](../CENTRAL_GRAPH_ROADMAP.md)

The system is currently evolving to a **Central Graph System** that simplifies graph traversal while maintaining the excellent multi-tenant, snapshot, and scene type systems. This evolution preserves the winning aspects of the current architecture while introducing:

- **Central Graph**: Single source of truth for all graph data
- **Subgraph System**: Logical groupings of nodes for efficient traversal
- **Enhanced Scene Items**: Spatial positioning for all scene types
- **Improved Performance**: Optimized graph operations and caching

## Core Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Central Graph**: Canonical data and relationships (single source of truth)
- **Subgraph System**: Logical groupings of nodes for efficient traversal and organization
- **Scene**: Presentational arrangements with enhanced scene items for spatial positioning
- **Deck**: Collections of related scenes for presentation and navigation
- **Context**: Anchors and coordinates within scenes, documents, and other content
- **Tenant**: Isolated content environments with shared feedback aggregation
- **Snapshot**: Deterministic serialization for instant loading and CDN delivery

### 2. Invariant Enforcement
- **Central Graph Integrity**: All graph operations must maintain data consistency
- **Subgraph Boundaries**: Subgraphs must contain valid node references
- **Edge weights are required and must be numeric**
- **Style cascade**: Type defaults â†’ Scene theme â†’ Instance overrides
- **Engagement aggregation rolls up to Central Graph counters across all tenants**
- **Contexts must resolve to valid Scene+Deck coordinates within tenant scope**
- **Tenant isolation must be maintained for content while allowing shared feedback**
- **Scene Items must have valid spatial positioning and item references**

### 3. Performance & Scalability
- **Subgraph-based caching**: Efficient caching of logical node groupings
- **Aggressive caching via Snapshots**
- **CDN-friendly static delivery**
- **Progressive hydration on the client**
- **Debounced rebuild triggers (500ms-2s)**
- **Tenant-aware caching and performance optimization**
- **Lazy loading of subgraph nodes and edges**

### 4. Multi-Tenant Architecture
- **Content Isolation**: Each tenant has isolated scenes, decks, and presentations
- **Subgraph Sharing**: Controlled sharing of subgraphs across tenants with access policies
- **Feedback Aggregation**: All feedback flows back to centralized Central Graph
- **Shared Knowledge**: Central Graph serves as shared knowledge base across tenants
- **Tenant Management**: Centralized tenant administration with isolated content

### 5. Standing-Based Permissions
- **Standing System**: User progression based on reputation, engagement, and affinity
- **Trust Scoring**: Reliability metrics for security-sensitive operations
- **Progressive Access**: Features unlock as users advance through standing levels
- **Resource Allocation**: Automatic resource assignment based on standing
- **Community Leadership**: Natural leaders emerge through standing-based recognition

## System Invariants

### 1. Core â†” System Scene Mirror
- Any CRUD operation on Core entities **must** mirror to System Scene
- Deleting from System Scene deletes underlying Core entity
- Non-system Scenes can freely manipulate linked/phantom elements

### 2. Edge Weight Requirements
- Every Core Edge must have a numeric weight (default: 1.0)
- Scene Edges inherit weight from Core or set scene-specific values
- Weight affects graph algorithms and visual representation

### 3. Style Cascade Resolution
```
Effective Style = Type Defaults + Scene Theme + Instance Overrides
```
- Server and client must resolve consistently
- Registry validation ensures type safety
- Fallback chain for missing values

### 4. Engagement Aggregation
- Discussions, bookmarks, notes accumulate to Core counters across all tenants
- Background jobs handle aggregation from tenant-isolated feedback
- Phantom-only anchors roll up to nearest Core link
- Tenant feedback contributes to shared knowledge base

### 5. Context Resolution
- Contexts must resolve to valid Scene+Deck coordinates within tenant scope
- Document contexts must reference valid text positions
- Graph contexts must reference valid node/edge positions
- Fallback to nearest valid context on resolution failure

### 6. Tenant Content Management
- Content (scenes, decks, contexts) can be tenant-specific or shared across tenants
- Feedback must flow to centralized Core Graph for shared knowledge
- Tenant configurations must not leak between tenants
- Shared resources (Core Graph) must be accessible to all tenants
- Content can be licensed and shared between tenants through the Content Sharing System

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Benefits

- **Guided Navigation**: Author-controlled progression through defined steps
- **Free Exploration**: User ability to explore content while maintaining flow context
- **Resume Capability**: Return to flow progression from any exploration point
- **Rewind/Return**: Navigate back to previous steps or return to current step view

#### **Flow Control Modes**
- **Guided Mode**: Strict step-by-step progression with limited exploration
- **Free-Explore Mode**: Full exploration capability while maintaining flow context
- **Hybrid Mode**: Exploration allowed during pauses, guided during active flow
- **Branch Mode**: Multiple path options with return-to-flow capability

#### **Flow Features**
