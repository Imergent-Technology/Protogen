# Phase 5: UI Integration & Authoring - Expanded Vision

## Overview

Phase 5 represents a major expansion of the Protogen platform's authoring capabilities, transforming it from a content management system into a comprehensive graph authoring and presentation platform. This phase focuses on building sophisticated tools for creating, editing, and managing scenes with type-specific optimizations.

## Key Design Milestones

### 🚨 **Card Scene Authoring - Design Milestone**

## Design Principles

### Node Selection Interface
- **Universal**: Works across all scene types and authoring tools
- **Context-aware**: Adapts UI based on single vs multi-select mode
- **Search-driven**: Live metadata search with graph/list views
- **Integration-ready**: Seamlessly connects to scene creation workflows

### Scene Authoring
- **Type-optimized**: Different tools for different scene types
- **Metadata-first**: Start with scene configuration, then content
- **Import-driven**: Core Graph selection drives initial content
- **Presentation-focused**: Tools for hiding/removing elements for display

### Graph Studio Integration
- **Admin-focused**: Integrated into admin panel as top-level feature
- **Cross-compatible**: Works with both graph and non-graph scenes
- **Link-aware**: Enables creation of navigational connections
- **Metadata-rich**: Provides context and information on demand

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 5A: Foundation (Immediate)
1. **Node Selection Interface** - Core functionality for all authoring tools
2. **Graph Scene Authoring** - Basic workflow for graph-based scenes
3. **Global Graph Studio Integration** - Admin panel integration

### Phase 5B: Scene Types (Next)
1. **Document Scene Authoring** - Text and media content tools
2. **Custom Scene Types** - Extensible architecture
3. **Type-optimized workflows** - Specialized tools per type

### Phase 5C: Card Authoring (Design Milestone)
1. **Card Scene Authoring** - 🚨 **AWAITING USER DESIGN INPUT**
2. **Advanced presentation capabilities** - To be defined
3. **Card-specific workflows** - To be defined

## Technical Considerations

### Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Each scene type has its own authoring module
- **Shared Components**: Common UI elements across all scene types
- **API Integration**: Seamless connection to backend services
- **State Management**: Consistent state across all authoring tools

### Performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Load scene type tools on demand
