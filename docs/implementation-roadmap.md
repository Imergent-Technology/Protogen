## Implementation Notes

### Multi-Tenant Architecture Benefits
- **Content Isolation**: Each tenant has isolated scenes, decks, and presentations
- **Feedback Aggregation**: All feedback flows back to centralized Core Graph
- **Shared Knowledge**: Core Graph serves as shared knowledge base across tenants
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling per tenant with independent optimization

### Stage System Removal Benefits
- **Clean Architecture**: No legacy Stage system to maintain
- **Modern Design**: Scene & Deck system provides better content organization
- **Simplified Codebase**: Reduced complexity and maintenance overhead
- **Better Performance**: No Stage-related database queries or API calls

### Technical Architecture
- **Tenant Isolation**: Database-level tenant scoping
- **Configuration Management**: Scoped tenant configurations (global, content, presentation, feedback)
- **Feedback Flow**: Tenant â†’ Core Graph aggregation with background processing
- **Performance**: Tenant-aware caching and CDN distribution
