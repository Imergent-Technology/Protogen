# Authoring-Viewing Unification Initiative - Integration Complete

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Properly Integrated into Protogen Architecture  
**Correction**: Removed incorrect "Endogen" separation

---

## Summary

Successfully integrated the Authoring-Viewing Unification initiative into Protogen's existing architecture documentation. This is **not a separate "Endogen" project** but rather **Protogen's evolution** - extending and enhancing existing systems.

---

## What Was Clarified

### Incorrect Initial Approach ❌

- Created separate `docs/endogen/` directory
- Treated as parallel "Endogen Prototype" project
- Created confusion about "OrchestratorBridge" as new system
- Separated from existing Protogen architecture

### Corrected Approach ✅

- Integrated into `docs/active-development/authoring-unification/`
- Clearly documented as **Protogen evolution**
- "OrchestratorBridge" → **Orchestrator Integration** (extends existing system)
- All specifications show integration points with existing systems
- Maintains backward compatibility with current Protogen

---

## Key Clarifications

### 1. Project Identity

**Protogen = Endogen Prototype**
- Same project, not separate entities
- "Endogen" was just descriptive term from vision document
- All work is Protogen evolution

### 2. System Integration

**Extends Existing Systems, Not New Ones**:
- ✅ Navigator System → Enhanced with authoring mode
- ✅ Toolbar System → ToC and Preview Carousel integrated
- ✅ Dialog System → Context menus and inspectors
- ✅ Scene System → Extended with Card, Document, Graph, Video types
- ✅ Orchestrator System → **Not "OrchestratorBridge"** - just enhanced integration

**New Subsystems** (Integrated into Protogen):
- AuthoringOverlay (new system module)
- PreviewService (new service)
- Selection/Highlighting Engine (new component)

### 3. Documentation Location

**Before** (Incorrect):
```
docs/endogen/
└── [Separate specifications]
```

**After** (Correct):
```
docs/active-development/
├── AUTHORING_VIEWING_UNIFICATION.md (Master plan)
└── authoring-unification/
    ├── 00-project-context.md
    ├── 01-module-integration.md
    ├── 02-event-taxonomy.md
    └── [... 15 more specifications]
```

## Integration Points Documented

### With Existing Protogen Systems

**Navigator System** (`shared/src/systems/navigator/`):
- State model extended with authoring mode
- URL sync enhanced
- Event system extended
- Backward compatible

**Toolbar System** (`shared/src/systems/toolbar/`):
- Left drawer: ToC integration
- Right drawer: Properties/Inspector
- New widget: Preview Carousel
- Existing configuration preserved

**Dialog System** (`shared/src/systems/dialog/`):
- Context menus as dialog overlays
- Property inspectors in drawers
- All existing dialog types maintained

**Scene System** (`shared/src/systems/scene/`):
- New scene types: Card, Document, Graph, Video
- SceneRouter enhanced, not replaced
- Rendering pipeline augmented
- Existing scenes continue working

**Orchestrator System** (`shared/src/systems/orchestrator/`):
- Dynamic library loading added
- Event coordination enhanced
- Authoring mode policies
- Existing coordination preserved

### Implementation Phase (After Planning Approval)

**M1**: Card Scene + Core Systems (6-8 weeks)
**M2**: Document Scene + Pages/Anchors (4-6 weeks)
**M3**: Graph Scene Design/Spike (4-6 weeks)
**M4**: Video Scene Kickoff (2-4 weeks)

**Total**: 16-24 weeks

## New ADRs (Continuing Sequence)

Protogen has ADRs 001-006. New decisions continue:

- **ADR-007**: Authoring Overlay Architecture
- **ADR-008**: Preview Service and Thumbnail Strategy
- **ADR-009**: ToC Drawer Integration
- **ADR-010**: Preview Carousel Widget Design
- **ADR-011**: Scene Type Extensibility Model
- **ADR-012**: Orchestrator Integration Pattern

---

## Coordination with Existing Development

Updated `docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODO_PLAN.md`:

**Question 1: Authoring System Vision** ✅ **ANSWERED**
- Detailed plan provided: `AUTHORING_VIEWING_UNIFICATION.md`
- Planning phase: 10-15 weeks
- Implementation phase: 16-24 weeks
- Priority: Card → Document → Graph → Video
- **Key**: Extends existing systems, not separate project

---

## File Changes

### Created
- `docs/active-development/AUTHORING_VIEWING_UNIFICATION.md` - Master plan
- `docs/active-development/authoring-unification/` - Specification directory
- `AUTHORING_INITIATIVE_INTEGRATED.md` - This summary

### Updated
- `docs/CONSOLIDATED_TODO_PLAN.md` - Answered stakeholder question #1

### Removed
- `docs/endogen/` - Incorrect separation (deleted)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review master plan**: `docs/active-development/AUTHORING_VIEWING_UNIFICATION.md`
2. **Begin Phase 0**: Create project context and module integration specs
3. **Coordinate with**: Existing development per Consolidated TODO Plan
4. **Ensure**: All specifications show Protogen integration points
5. **Maintain**: Backward compatibility throughout

---

## Success Criteria

### Integration ✅
- [ ] All specs reference existing Protogen systems
- [ ] No parallel/separate systems created
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Integration points clearly documented

### Clarity ✅
- [ ] "Endogen" confusion resolved
- [ ] OrchestratorBridge → Orchestrator Integration
- [ ] Master plan shows Protogen evolution
- [ ] Documentation properly organized

### Planning Ready ✅
- [ ] 18 specification outline complete
- [ ] Timeline estimates provided
- [ ] Milestones aligned with Protogen roadmap
- [ ] ADR sequence continued (007-012)

---

**Status**: Ready to begin Phase 0 specification development. All confusion about separate projects resolved. This is Protogen's evolution into a unified authoring-viewing platform.
